## Gameplay

### Starting a game

From the homepage, the player can either join a game created by their friend by entering the four digit code or they can create a new game versus a human or a computer. The player who creates the game will see the room code and gets to choose the game variant.

### How to play

Both players roll a die to go first. To make a move, click on one of your checkers. The highlighted spaces show where you are able to move. Checkers can be moved a number of spaces equal to the number on each dice. The object of the game is to advance your checkers all the way around the board before your opponent. To learn more, follow the links for each variant.
