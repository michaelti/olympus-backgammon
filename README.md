## Gameplay

### Starting a game

From the homepage, the player can either join a game created by their friend by entering the four digit code or they can create a new game versus a human or a computer. The player who creates the game will see the room code and gets to choose the game variant.

### How to play

Both players roll a die to go first. To make a move, click on one of your checkers. The highlighted spaces show where you are able to move. Checkers can be moved a number of spaces equal to the number on each dice. The object of the game is to advance your checkers all the way around the board before your opponent.
